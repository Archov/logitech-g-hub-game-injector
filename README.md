# Logitech G Hub settings extractor
This is a small python tool to extract the json file stored inside the "settings.db" file of the Logitech G Hub app. This allows you to update the json and then replace the file blob inside the db with the new json.
# Requirements
You need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. I've tested with 3.9 but I think 2.x versions should work too.
# How to use
Simply follow the instructions after executing the py file:
```
python ghub-settings.py
```
